## About COVID-19 Shiny Dashboard
  
This shiny web application aims to help users to get a deeper understanding of this pandemic. The latest open data on the COVID-19 spread are regularly downloaded and displayed in a map, summary tables and plots. The dashboard is segmented into several sections that can be selected on the left side of the browser window. You can also find the R Shiny dashboard I created [here](https://yawen.shinyapps.io/shiny-assessment-yawenzhang9701/)

### Map and Table
  
```{r map1, fig.cap="COVID-19 Dashboard — Overview Map Section"}
knitr::include_graphics("graph/map.png")
```
  
This map section of the dashboard shows the world map and a list of countries with their respective number of confirmed, recovered and death cases. A time-lapse feature with a simple slider is included to get an idea on about the development of the pandemic. Users could also choose the different types of data in the map by clicking the checkbox, which contains confirmed, recovered and deaths.

### Graph
